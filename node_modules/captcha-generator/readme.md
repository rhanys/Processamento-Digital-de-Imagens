## Install

```
$ npm install --save captcha-generator
```
# Overview
This is a captcha generator that can only generate image verification code because I do not like [ccap](https://github.com/DoubleSpout/ccap), ccap uses not only trouble but also low performance and easy memory leak. captcha-generator can also be used across platforms.
